Week 3 - Inheritance 2 

1. The parent class in this code is the Spell class, and the Child classes are the Accio and Confundo classes. 

2. Base class in this code is the Spell class, and the Sub-classes are the Accio and Confundo classes. 

3. The output of this code would be a syntax error because of the use of this (’) quotation instead of (') or ("). 

4. The get_description method from the Confundo class is called when study_spell(Confundo()) is executed because study_spell takes in an instance of a Spell class as an argument, and Confundo is a subclass of Spell, so an instance of the Confundo class is a valid argument for the study_spell function. In this particular case, the get_description method from the Confundo class is called because it is specified in the Confundo class and overrides the implementation in the Spell class.

5. We would need to add this code into the Accio class if we want to print the description of "This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance"

	def get_description(self):
     	   return ‘This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance.’
